      #Specific Examples + Instructions

      ##Introductions (slide 3)
      Have mentors join you at front of class and get them to say their name and favourite website/game. Inform learners that the mentors will be here to help them if they have any problems, and not to be afraid to ask them questions if they get stuck, or if they just want to show them something cool!

      ##Coders' Code (slide 6)
      *Ask for help*: If you’re stuck or having trouble with something, work with the person beside you, or put up your hand to ask the facilitator or one of our mentors for help.

      *Be present*: We really want you to learn a lot in this workshop, so make sure to pay attention and follow along with the activities.

      *Try your best*:Even the best coders have trouble sometimes, so we don’t expect you to do everything perfectly the first time, but make sure you’re trying your best. Don’t be afraid to try things out and make mistakes!

      ##Brainstorm (slide 10)
      Have learners Think, Pair, Share: Think to themselves, possibly write their ideas down, then pair up and discuss with 1-2 other people near them, and be prepared to share what they talked about with the entire class.

      ##Internet safety means.. (slide 11)
      Be prepared for learners to share stories of themselves or others being unsafe or mean online. Respond by asking them how they could have responded in a more safe or kind way, or brainstorm as a group how we could respond if we come across a similar situation in the future.

      Use **slide 12** as a space to write down any additional ideas learners come up with after discussing in pairs. If you do not refresh your tab, the notes will stay on the slide even after you move to the next slide.

      #Username generator.. what is it? (slide 14)
      Ask "How can a username generator help us be more safe online?"

      #Example project (slide 15)
      Open up the example project in a new tab. Demonstrate how to run the program. Show the code and ask what learners see - see if they can 'decode' any of it!

      See the [original example code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfO4tuajxwgz5MPB3IFrZLeTUuYlLG2Y/view?usp=sharing) if there are any issues with the example in repl.it.

      #Coding with Python (slide 19)
      We are using repl.it to code in Python today. Repl.it is a cloud coding environment, and you can use for coding in many different languages.

      Have learners sign in using the same login. Remind learners to be careful not to edit or delete any projects that don't belong to them.

      ##String a sentence together (slide 21)
      Just like we string letters onto a bracelet.

      ##Say hello (slide 22)
      Enter your code, then click on “Run”. Whenever you see something with a #hashtag in front of it, you don’t need to type that part (although it is helpful). This is called a comment, which the computer ignores, but programmers use to organize their code and remember what everything means.

      ##Number savvy (slide 23)
      We can also work with numbers with decimals - called floats.

      ##Math whiz (slide 24)
      Q: Who here is good at math?

      Ruby is really, really good at math! These symbols are called operators (e.g. “+”). We can use them to give Ruby math equations to solve. She can help us with our math homework!
      Have a volunteer race Ruby to answer a math equation.

      ##Concatentation (slide 25)
      Point out the space we have between Hello and World, ask what would happen if we did not account for the space here (HelloWorld).

      ##Mystery box (slide 26)
      In this example, the variable (named “box”) can store either the word (string) ten or the number (integer) 10.

      ##Stay sharp (slide 27)
      Try this activity standing up! If you have a whiteboard, write: *box = 3* - Otherwise, verbally define the integer.

      Next, write: *box = "blueberry"* (e.g.) - Go through these tasks as a group.

      ##So Random (slide 30)
      Explain 'what is a library'. A library is a collection of code that we can use to help us complete difficult or compliated tasks.

      ##Casting (slide 39)
      Take a moment to talk about why we are casting. Adding a string (a word) and a number doesn't make sense to Python just like it doesn't make sense to us.
      Discuss how we can turn 5 into "5" but we can't turn something like "cat" into a number, we can only cast if it makes sense.

      <!-- add more notes here-->

      ##Demos (slide 43)
      Invite learners to come to the front to showcase their python program, or have learners tuck in their chairs, open their projects, and walk around to view projects Gallery-Walk-Style.

      ##Today we learned (slide 44)
      Ask learners what they learned today, and review the examples on this slide.
